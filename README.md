What is Data Science?

Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. But how is this different from what statisticians have been doing for years?

The answer lies in the difference between explaining and predicting. 

Data Analyst v/s Data Science - Edureka

As you can see from the above image, a Data Analyst usually explains what is going on by processing history of the data. On the other hand, Data Scientist not only does the exploratory analysis to discover insights from it, but also uses various advanced machine learning algorithms to identify the occurrence of a particular event in the future. A Data Scientist will look at the data from many angles, sometimes angles not known earlier.

So, Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.

    Predictive causal analytics – If you want a model that can predict the possibilities of a particular event in the future, you need to apply predictive causal analytics. Say, if you are providing money on credit, then the probability of customers making future credit payments on time is a matter of concern for you. Here, you can build a model that can perform predictive analytics on the payment history of the customer to predict if the future payments will be on time or not.

    Prescriptive analytics: If you want a model that has the intelligence of taking its own decisions and the ability to modify it with dynamic parameters, you certainly need prescriptive analytics for it. This relatively new field is all about providing advice. In other terms, it not only predicts but suggests a range of prescribed actions and associated outcomes.
    The best example for this is Google’s self-driving car which I had discussed earlier too. The data gathered by vehicles can be used to train self-driving cars. You can run algorithms on this data to bring intelligence to it. This will enable your car to take decisions like when to turn, which path to take, when to slow down or speed up.

    Machine learning for making predictions — If you have transactional data of a finance company and need to build a model to determine the future trend, then machine learning algorithms are the best bet. This falls under the paradigm of supervised learning. It is called supervised because you already have the data based on which you can train your machines. For example, a fraud detection model can be trained using a historical record of fraudulent purchases.

    Machine learning for pattern discovery — If you don’t have the parameters based on which you can make predictions, then you need to find out the hidden patterns within the dataset to be able to make meaningful predictions. This is nothing but the unsupervised model as you don’t have any predefined labels for grouping. The most common algorithm used for pattern discovery is Clustering.
    Let’s say you are working in a telephone company and you need to establish a network by putting towers in a region. Then, you can use the clustering technique to find those tower locations which will ensure that all the users receive optimum signal strength.

Let’s see how the proportion of above-described approaches differ for Data Analysis as well as Data Science. As you can see in the image below, Data Analysis includes descriptive analytics and prediction to a certain extent. On the other hand, Data Science is more about Predictive Causal Analytics and Machine Learning.

Now that you know what exactly is Data Science, let now find out the reason why it was needed in the first place.
Why Data Science?

    Traditionally, the data that we had was mostly structured and small in size, which could be analyzed by using simple BI tools. Unlike data in the traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. Let’s have a look at the data trends in the image given below which shows that by 2020, more than 80 % of the data will be unstructured.

    This data is generated from different sources like financial logs, text files, multimedia forms, sensors, and instruments. Simple BI tools are not capable of processing this huge volume and variety of data. This is why we need more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it.

This is not the only reason why Data Science has become so popular. Let’s dig deeper and see how Data Science is being used in various domains.

    How about if you could understand the precise requirements of your customers from the existing data like the customer’s past browsing history, purchase history, age and income. No doubt you had all this data earlier too, but now with the vast amount and variety of data, you can train models more effectively and recommend the product to your customers with more precision. Wouldn’t it be amazing as it will bring more business to your organization?

    Let’s take a different scenario to understand the role of Data Science in decision making. How about if your car had the intelligence to drive you home? The self-driving cars collect live data from sensors, including radars, cameras, and lasers to create a map of its surroundings. Based on this data, it takes decisions like when to speed up, when to speed down, when to overtake, where to take a turn – making use of advanced machine learning algorithms.
    Let’s see how Data Science can be used in predictive analytics. Let’s take weather forecasting as an example. Data from ships, aircraft, radars, satellites can be collected and analyzed to build models. These models will not only forecast the weather but also help in predicting the occurrence of any natural calamities. It will help you to take appropriate measures beforehand and save many precious lives.

Let’s have a look at the below infographic to see all the domains where Data Science is creating its impression.

Data Science Use Cases - Edureka
Who is a Data Scientist?

There are several definitions available on Data Scientists. In simple words, a Data Scientist is one who practices the art of Data Science. The term “Data Scientist” has been coined after considering the fact that a Data Scientist draws a lot of information from the scientific fields and applications whether it is statistics or mathematics.
What does a Data Scientist do?

Data scientists are those who crack complex data problems with their strong expertise in certain scientific disciplines. They work with several elements related to mathematics, statistics, computer science, etc (though they may not be an expert in all these fields). They make a lot of use of the latest technologies in finding solutions and reaching conclusions that are crucial for an organization’s growth and development. Data Scientists present the data in a much more useful form as compared to the raw data available to them from structured as well as unstructured forms.

Moving further, lets now discuss BI. I am sure you might have heard of Business Intelligence (BI) too. Often Data Science is confused with BI. I will state some concise and clear contrasts between the two which will help you in getting a better understanding. Let’s have a look.
Business Intelligence (BI) vs. Data Science

    Business Intelligence (BI) basically analyzes the previous data to find hindsight and insight to describe business trends. Here BI enables you to take data from external and internal sources, prepare it, run queries on it and create dashboards to answer questions like quarterly revenue analysis or business problems. BI can evaluate the impact of certain events in the near future.

    Data Science is a more forward-looking approach, an exploratory way with the focus on analyzing the past or current data and predicting the future outcomes with the aim of making informed decisions. It answers the open-ended questions as to “what” and “how” events occur.

Let’s have a look at some contrasting features.
Features	Business Intelligence (BI)	Data Science
Data Sources	 Structured
(Usually SQL, often Data Warehouse)	 Both Structured and Unstructured

( logs, cloud data, SQL, NoSQL, text)
Approach	Statistics and Visualization	Statistics, Machine Learning, Graph Analysis, Neuro- linguistic Programming (NLP)
Focus	Past and Present	Present and Future
Tools	Pentaho, Microsoft BI, QlikView, R	RapidMiner, BigML, Weka, R
